# wacm-app
Front-end dashboard for managing a user bot on a discord server to manage structure, users, and verification.
- React.js
- SCSS
- RESTful APIS
- JSX / Babel

# Purpose
Front-end to interact with https://github.com/diggitydingdong/wsu_verify. While a purely CLI interface within Discord would have been possible, given the large amount of information to manage, it simply was not feasible to do it this way.

## If I had more time / were to do it again
- As with the back-end, I would have used TypeScript. It would have simplified the process immensely.
- I would re-write the Tab system. In my [React Component Library](https://github.com/diggitydingdong/diggity-react-uikit) I wrote a much cleaner and simpler implementation.

## Implementation
The front-end is written using React.js (using create-react-app), using SCSS modules to modularise the CSS (DRY - don't repeat yourself!).
